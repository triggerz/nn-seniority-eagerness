# Description

There are occasional disputes about being allocated to the most interesting (and complicated) tasks in your team, consisting only of academics. The most senior employees expect to be first in line for these tasks and this creates conflicts with the younger employees. When the senior employees conduct these tasks, they are solved to your satisfaction at the first attempt. And the workload in your department is heavy at the moment. However, some of the senior employees are often absent due to sick children, which can make it difficult to reach tight deadlines. On the other hand, the younger employees really want to gain experience with these tasks and are reaching out to get them. Who will you give the next interesting task to?

# Choice
You will give the next task to one of your senior employees.

# Variables
 - Resources: -1
 - Engagement: -1
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
This is the easy choice - giving the tasks to an employee with high seniority. You'll get the job done - in your preferred manner. However, the younger and less experienced employees also need to be trained to handle these tasks. This is what motivates the younger employees.

# Outcome
X

# Choice
You give the task to one of your senior employees and at the following team meeting  use the opportunity to talk about the behaviour amongst your senior employees. You emphasize their responsibility to help and develop the more inexperienced colleagues. 

# Variables
 - Resources: -1
 - Engagement: -2
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
You're aware this is an issue in your team that needs to be addressed. Talking to your senior employees might be a way to solve this. Maybe you could even motivate them to help train the younger employees?

# Outcome
X

# Choice
You give the task to a younger employee and observe with interest how the senior employees react.      

# Variables
 - Resources: -3
 - Engagement: -3
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
Giving the younger employees the possibility to develop by allocating an interesting task to them is a good idea. Even though you are busy and the workload is heavy, we must take the time to develop our employees. This makes the team less vulnerable in the long run, since all employees will be trained to perform the interesting and more complicated tasks. 

# Outcome
X
